The Aqua Project, started on November 3rd, 2021,  and changed it's name to FireAqua around Christmas. The site was redone in January 2022 and the former FireWave developers came to help development of the site. In February 2022, the site was translated into English by Zai, so the site can be understood by an English audience. FireAqua was released on June 24th, 2022, after 7 months of development.",
  "objectif-title": "What is the objective of FireAqua?",
  "objectif-content": "The main objective of FireAqua is to expand my community, without staying on a restricted platform (YouTube). You can read the latest news, and download my packs, so you can install older versions of Windows. The site benefits from an English translation so both the English and French speaking audience of my channel and understand the same site.",

  "youtube-content-1": "New year, new resolution! This year, I sent my cards, and as you can see, I've created a website, which you know as FireAqua. It is also time to announce my other projects. To start, I have to pass my college exams (which validates our skills when college is over). Moreover, I have to write an internship report which will waste my time. I have to make sure to have a good grade, and have consistent uploads on YouTube in order to stay active.<br>To start, outside of school, I will imporve my setup and buy myself new appliances for my videos.",
  "youtube-content-2": "After that, I will try to reach 500 subscribers. For this year I want to go for 1000 subscribers, which seems like an impossible challenge at the moment. I will try to make more videos in English. I'm also going to start two new projects. The first is related to computers, and the second is related to the Python programming language. I can only tell you what these are once FireAqua opens.",
  "youtube-content-3": "For 2022, I will move forward on YouTube, and I will improve the quality of my setup. Even with an exam, as hellish as getting a BSOD in Progressbar95 is, I'll prepare to have 1,000 subscribers. Videos in English, a new site, and interesting projects. This year, I will give everything!",

  "torrent-title": "Why are files in .torrent?",
  "torrent-why": "Files larger than 100MB are in .torrent for 2 reasons.<br>The first reason is that our site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and they don't allow large file sizes. <br><strong>I recommend using qBitTorrent. Some torrent clients, like ÂµTorrent are filled with ads and some can even be filled with viruses.</strong><br>The second reason is to reduce storage space. I don't want a folder that's several GB large.",
